# TCP_Implementation

This is an implementation of TCP using the UDP protocol in order to understand reliable packet trasnfer. 

This version of TCP is capable of the following:
    - tolerates packet drops
    - allows other concurrent connections a fair chance 
    - does not give up the entire bandwidth to other connections
